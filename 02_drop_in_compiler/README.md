# `zig cc` as a Drop-in Compiler Replacement
The easisest possible way to try Zig, is to replace `arm-none-eabi-gcc` with Zig's own command line compiler `zig cc`.
## Information Gathering

Before we even touch Zig's compiler, it's useful to gather information on what exactly our *current* compiler is doing when we build.
Examing the [Makefile](./Makefile) generated by ST, I want to highlight a couple of things:

Compiler setup:
``` Makefile
PREFIX = arm-none-eabi-
# The gcc compiler bin path can be either defined in make command via GCC_PATH variable (> make GCC_PATH=xxx)
# either it can be added to the PATH environment variable.
ifdef GCC_PATH
CC = $(GCC_PATH)/$(PREFIX)gcc
AS = $(GCC_PATH)/$(PREFIX)gcc -x assembler-with-cpp
CP = $(GCC_PATH)/$(PREFIX)objcopy
SZ = $(GCC_PATH)/$(PREFIX)size
else
CC = $(PREFIX)gcc
AS = $(PREFIX)gcc -x assembler-with-cpp
CP = $(PREFIX)objcopy
SZ = $(PREFIX)size
endif
HEX = $(CP) -O ihex
BIN = $(CP) -O binary -S
```

This sets up what utility actually gets called at various steps in the compilation process. This isn't a tutorial on compilation, but one interesting thing of note is:

``` Makefile
AS = $(PREFIX)gcc -x assembler-with-cpp
```

The compiler used to compile assembly files (`.s/.S`) is just the normal `arm-none-eabi-gcc` with the arg `-x assembler-with-cpp` which roughly means: "The language I'm compiling is assembly code, but it also has C pre-processor commands (`#define`s, etc.) so please support those".

Some more critical lines to pay attention to in the order they appear:

``` Makefile
# cpu
CPU = -mcpu=cortex-m7

# fpu
FPU = -mfpu=fpv5-sp-d16

# float-abi
FLOAT-ABI = -mfloat-abi=hard

# mcu
MCU = $(CPU) -mthumb $(FPU) $(FLOAT-ABI)
```

This tells the compiler what architecture/cpu/floating-point hardware configuration to actually compile code for, we'll have to do the same equivalent setup with `zig cc` later (spoiler: the arguments are almost identical).

``` Makefile
LIBS = -lc -lm -lnosys 
```

Links in the C standard library, math library, and "nosys" library in that order. The "nosys" library provides non-functional stubs for all the normal "OS" level functions (`fwrite()`, `fopen()`, `exit()`, etc.) that aren't implemented due to not *having* an OS when running "bare metal". Confusingly, ST also auto-generates [syscalls.c](./Core/Src/syscalls.c) which *also* does this. That will come up later.

``` Makefile
-specs=nano.specs
```

You can find more information on spec files [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Spec-Files.html), however this particular one does the following:
- Any time `-lc` (the C standard library) is linked in, actually use `-lc_nano`, which is the "nano" variant of the newlib standard C library. 

Newlib, and newlib-nano, are bundled with `arm-none-eabi-gcc` as pre-compiled binaries. The compiler knows which ones to choose automatically based on `-mcpu`, `-mfpu`, `-mfloat-abi` and `-mthumb` compiler args. `zig cc` will not know which one to choose, or even where to find it, which we'll get to later.

Now we're *almost* ready to get started with porting, but there's one more extremely helpful thing we can do. If the linker argument `Wl,--verbose` is added to the linker args via `LDFLAGS` variable, it can give us some easy information about what precisely is getting linked into our code. Running `make | grep succeeded` produces the following:

Interesting! Putting the object files generated from our source code aside, we can see we linked in all sorts of stuff! Also note how the paths are tuned to our specific architecture: `.../thumb/v7e-m+fp/hard/...`. Try messing around with floating point compile flags to see how the paths change.

The following files are responsible for initializing the C runtime on your device. You can read more about them [here](https://www.filibeto.org/unix/tru64/lib/ossc/doc/cygnus_doc-99r1/html/6_embed/embcrt0_the_main_startup_file.html) but generally speaking they are what's responsible for gracefully starting/ending your C program, calling C "constructors" and "destructors", etc.
```
crt0.o
crti.o
crtbegin.o
crtend.o
crtn.o
```

And here are the actual pre-compiled library files corresponding to our `-l...` library includes seen earlier, with one additional one, `libgcc.a`. An explanation of that one can be found [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Libgcc.html);
```
libc_nano.a
libm.a
libnosys.a
libgcc.a
```

## Modifying our Linker Script
If you try to compile at this point, you would notice an error like so:
```
ld.lld: error: STM32F750N8Hx_FLASH.ld:56: memory region not defined: RAM
>>> _estack = ORIGIN(RAM) + LENGTH(RAM);    /* end of RAM */
```

Zig uses LLVM's linker `ld.lld` to link. Linker scripts are sadly not standardized across compilers, so this linker interprets our linker script slightly differently than `arm-none-eabi-ld`. Fortunately, this is quite easy to fix, we just need to move the declaration for `_estack` to after the region `RAM` is defined.

There's one other change want to make as well. ST's default script defines a section:
``` ld
/* User_heap_stack section, used to check that there is enough RAM left */
  ._user_heap_stack :
  {
    . = ALIGN(8);
    PROVIDE ( end = . );
    PROVIDE ( _end = . );
    . = . + _Min_Heap_Size;
    . = . + _Min_Stack_Size;
    . = ALIGN(8);
  } >RAM
```
This section is in RAM (and thus wont' be flashed to the device), so it really should be marked with `(NOLOAD)` like so:
``` ld
/* User_heap_stack section, used to check that there is enough RAM left */
  ._user_heap_stack (NOLOAD) :
  {
    . = ALIGN(8);
    PROVIDE ( end = . );
    PROVIDE ( _end = . );
    . = . + _Min_Heap_Size;
    . = . + _Min_Stack_Size;
    . = ALIGN(8);
  } >RAM
```

Diff the linker script from this project with the base project to see all changes

## Modifying our Makefile

Armed with our previously gathered information, we can make a new Makefile to use `zig cc` instead of `arm-none-eabi-gcc`. You can diff our new [Makefile](./Makefile) with the [Makefile](../01_base_project/Makefile) from the base project to see what changed. I've marked + commented changed lines with `CHANGE NOTE:` so all explanations are contained within the modified Makefile. An overview of the steps taken:
- We switch our compiler to use `zig cc`
- We change some compiler arguments to match what `zig cc` expects
- We add an additional system include path using `-isystem` to point at our `arm-none-eabi-gcc` installation so we can manually link in pre-compiled libraries
With these modifications
- We ditch linking in `-lgcc` and `-lnosys`, see [Makefile](./Makefile) for a more detailed explanation
- We add `-fno-sanitize=all` flag to keep from bloating our binary by linking in clangs undefined behavior sanitizers 
And that's it! We (or at least I) now have a blinky program that blinks as expected when compiled with `arm-none-eabi-gcc` OR `zig cc`.
